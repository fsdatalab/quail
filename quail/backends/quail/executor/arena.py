"""Paged KV arena: preallocated per-layer buffers in fixed-size pages.

Pages are handed out from a free list and reached through block tables.

PageArena is the accounting of one pool (pure Python). KVArena adds the
two pools of a model with sliding layers, the rows each key holds, and
the K and V storage, which a device implementation supplies as a pools
object. KVArena itself imports neither torch nor MLX.

KVArena is the whole surface the chunk loop, the packer, the attention
paths, and the operator runtimes use. Everything they need is a method
or property on it; nothing outside this module reads the accounting
object directly. Its methods:

- allocation: alloc, activate, alloc_temporary, free_key, pin, grow
- retention: retain, evict_retained, evict_key, configure_retention,
  retention_cap_pages, retained_keys, retained_pages,
  retained_prefix_tokens
- residency: is_resident, resident_keys, owned_pages, capacity_rows,
  pages_needed, page_cost, held_cost, page_tokens, n_pages, free_pages
- the sliding window: has_sliding, origin, sliding_start, trim_window,
  owned_sliding_pages, capacity_rows_sliding, n_sliding_pages, resize
- attention inputs: layer_kv, paged_kv, block_table, block_table_rows
- counters: reset_stats, evicted_keys, evicted_pages,
  evicted_prefix_tokens
