"""Paged KV arena: preallocated per-layer buffers in fixed-size pages.

Pages are handed out from a free list and reached through block tables.

PageArena is the accounting (pure Python, CPU-tested); KVArena is the
tensor backing and runs only where torch and a GPU exist.

KVArena is the whole surface the chunk loop, the packer, the attention
paths, and the operator runtimes use. Everything they need is a method
or property on it; nothing outside this module reads the accounting
object or the K and V tensors directly. A replacement arena implements
the same methods:

- allocation: alloc, activate, alloc_temporary, free_key, pin, grow
- retention: retain, evict_retained, evict_key, configure_retention,
  retention_cap_pages, retained_keys, retained_pages,
  retained_prefix_tokens
- residency: is_resident, resident_keys, owned_pages, capacity_rows,
  pages_needed, page_cost, held_cost, page_tokens, n_pages, free_pages
- the sliding window: has_sliding, origin, sliding_start, trim_window,
  owned_sliding_pages, capacity_rows_sliding, n_sliding_pages, resize
- attention inputs: layer_kv, paged_kv, block_table, block_table_rows
- counters: reset_stats, evicted_keys, evicted_pages,
  evicted_prefix_tokens
