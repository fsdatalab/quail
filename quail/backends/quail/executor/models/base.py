"""The forward pass one model family runs over the shared engine.

A model pipeline owns the forward loop for one architecture: where the
modules sit in vLLM's loaded model, how the packed rows are embedded,
the per-layer block, and the final norm. It calls the Engine for the
kernels, quantization, attention paths, and arena access. The chunk
