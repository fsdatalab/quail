"""DiffusionGemma forward pass over vLLM's loaded module.

One pass per document: the prompt rows run in the model's encoder
mode (causal attention, KV written to the arena) and the canvas rows
that follow each answer cue run in its decoder mode (bidirectional
over the canvas, reading the whole prompt, KV never kept). The TRUE
and FALSE logits at the first canvas row are the answer, which is
what the model's own sampler commits on its first denoising step
when it is confident. There is no further denoising.

Layer order, from vLLM's Gemma4DecoderLayer: input RMSNorm, fused
QKV projection, per-head Q and K RMSNorm with rotary, unweighted V
RMSNorm, attention at softmax scale 1.0 (sliding window on the
sliding layers), output projection, post-attention RMSNorm, residual
add; pre-feedforward RMSNorm, the dense MLP and the routed experts
side by side with their own norms, post-feedforward RMSNorm,
residual add, per-layer scalar. Embeddings are scaled by
sqrt(hidden). Each canvas row's embedding passes through the
self-conditioning post-norm with a zero conditioning signal, as on
the sampler's first step.

The projections and expert kernels are the loaded vLLM modules,
called as they are: the checkpoint's fp8 weights carry per-channel
scales with per-token activation quantization, which vLLM's own
linear path handles. The norms and rotary go through the engine's
kernels. Attention and packing are Quail's.
