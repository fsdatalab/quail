"""Run one DiffusionGemma forward pass with Quail's batching and KV.

Each prompt ends with a fixed canvas token. Its embedding receives the
self-conditioning norm with zero conditioning, as in the first denoising
step. The answer comes from TRUE/FALSE scores at that position.

A chunk's images go through the checkpoint's vision tower and replace
their soft token rows before the first layer. Gemma 4 lets an image's
soft tokens see each other on its sliding-window layers and keeps its
full-attention layers causal, so the sliding layers run the engine's
block attention over meta["blocks"].
