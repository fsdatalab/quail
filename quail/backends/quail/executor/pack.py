            every partner tuple at that stage.
        chunk_budget: Tokens per forward pass.
        arena_pages: Pages in the KV arena.
        page_tokens: Tokens per arena page.
        frame_tokens: Per stage, tokens of the framing written into
            the anchor's KV ahead of its first suffix.
        resident: anchor -> pages already held. A resident anchor's
            prefix KV is in the arena, so it packs no prefix tokens.
        anchor_partners: anchor -> per stage, the indices into that
            stage's partner list the anchor streams, or None for the
            whole list. Omitted anchors stream the whole list at every
            stage. An anchor's value may instead be a callable(stage)
            -> list, None, DROP, or SKIP, asked when the anchor enters
            the stage; DROP takes the anchor out of the run there,
            SKIP passes it to the next stage with nothing asked (a
            stage after the first only).
        frame_canvas_tokens: Rows a diffusion model adds after a frame
            entry. They take chunk room and page room but are never
            kept in the anchor's KV. A suffix's canvas rows are part of
            its count in stage_suffixes.
        page_cost: Callable(tokens, base_tokens) giving the pages a
            key of that many rows takes, in the arena's every-token pages; None
            prices one pool of page_tokens pages.
        tree: A PrefixTree over the anchors given at construction, or
            None. Fresh anchors are admitted in tree order; one whose
            parent is still queued waits, one whose parent's pages can
            be borrowed packs and pays for only the tokens past its
            shared length, and one whose parent has left packs whole.
        can_borrow: Callable(anchor, parent, same_chunk) -> bool, asked
            before a borrow; same_chunk says the parent is admitted in
            the chunk being built. None allows every borrow.
        advance: Callable(anchor, stage, row) -> bool deciding, once an
            anchor's whole row at a stage is in, whether it goes on to
            the next stage, or at the last stage whether it survives.
            None advances an anchor as soon as one answer in the row
            is true.
        frame_writes: Per stage, whether its frame is written; a stage
            whose frame is already in the anchor's KV from the stage
            before packs no frame rows. None writes every frame.
        limit: Stop admitting anchors once this many survived the last
            stage; None runs every anchor.
        extra_tokens: Rows past the prefix an anchor's pages must
            cover, when more than its largest frame: a stage whose
            one suffix is written into the anchor's own pages.
        answer_dtype: The answer array type, one for every stage or a
            list per stage; None records 0/1 lists.

    Each chunk fills in priority order: partner streams cut by the
    previous chunk, then anchors starting their next stage, then
    fresh anchors whose pages fit the free list. Pages are granted in
    queue order; chunk room may be skipped. An anchor advances to its
    next stage once its whole stream at the current stage is launched
    and one partner has answered TRUE; the remaining answers fill in
    while the next stage runs. It drops out when every partner
    answered FALSE. An anchor with no partner at a stage settles
    without a chunk: finished with an empty row at the last stage,
    dropped at any earlier one.
