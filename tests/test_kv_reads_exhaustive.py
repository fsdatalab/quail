"""Every small corpus reads the right KV, on the tightest arena it fits.

A document is one to three whole pages, each all A tokens or all B
tokens, with or without a five-token tail. That covers the ways two
documents can share pages: not at all, part of a page, whole pages, a
whole document, and a duplicate whose length is a whole number of
pages. Every multiset of up to two such documents runs through a
filter, a two-stage filter, a join, and a filter feeding a join, on
both attention paths, a sliding-window arena, and a canvas row, with
the fewest arena pages and the smallest chunk budget it fits, where
admission blocks and parents wait. test_kv_reads covers large sizes.
See kv_checker for the check.
